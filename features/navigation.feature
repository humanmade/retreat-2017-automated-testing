Feature: View movie collection
  In order to see the movies in a collection
  As a visitor
  I need to be able to browse through the collection

  Background:
    Given there are movies in the collection:
      | name                    | rating    | genre                                | description                                                |
      | Minions                 | Universal | Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Family | Stuart, Kevin and Bob are recruited by Scarlet Overkill... |
      | Guardians of the Galaxy | 12        | Action, Adventure, Science Fiction   | Light years from Earth, 26 years after being abducted...   |
